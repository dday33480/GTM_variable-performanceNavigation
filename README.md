GTM Performance Naviagation Variable
This javascript code can be used to create a custom javascript variable within your Google Tag Manager.

The variable gives you details about user navigation whether the user has accessed the website page for the first time, wther the page access is refresh or whether the user has clicked the back arrow in the browser.

The variable can be useful as a trigger condition to ensure tracking tags are only triggered for a certain navigation type (ex. avoid tag triggering on page refreshes).
